Module 10-square contains several classes.
The parent class is called BaseGeometry. It has a public instance
method for calculating the area and validating integers.
There is a subclass called Rectangle. It has private attributes
for width and height that are validated by the parent class.
The Rectangle class extends the parentâ€™s area method and can be
printed using the str method.
There is also a subclass called Square. It has a private attribute
for size that is validated by the superclass. The Square class can
also be printed using the str method.
